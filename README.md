This project aims to develop a decentralized blockchain application that leverages the latest technologies of web 3.0. The application is built using Solidity, a high-level programming language used to write smart contracts on Ethereum. The Krypt Clone is designed to provide a secure and transparent platform for peer-to-peer transactions, enabling users to exchange digital assets with complete trust and immutability.

## Steps to Process a Transaction using Krypt

1. **Connect Wallet with MetaMask:**
   - First, install the MetaMask extension in your web browser.
   - Head over to `https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn`
   - Create a new MetaMask wallet or import an existing one.

2. **Install Sepolia Test Network:**
   - Head over to `https://sepolia.dev/#poweredByAlchemy` and click `+ add to metamask` , or
   - Open MetaMask and click on the network selection dropdown.
   - Select "Custom RPC" and provide the necessary network details for the Sepolia test network (such as the URL and chain ID).
   - Save the configuration and switch to the Sepolia test network.

3. **Add Test ETH from Sepolia Faucet:**
   - Open a web browser and navigate to the Sepolia faucet website: `https://sepoliafaucet.com/`
   - Follow the instructions on the website to request test ETH for your MetaMask wallet.
   - Wait for the transaction to be confirmed and for the test ETH to be added to your wallet.

4. **Create a New Sepolia Test Account on MetaMask:**
   - In MetaMask, click on the account dropdown.
   - Select "Create Account" to generate a new Sepolia test account.
   - Ensure that the newly created account is selected in MetaMask for performing the transaction.

5. **Interact with the Web App:**
   - Open the Krypt web app in your browser.
   - Navigate to the transaction section of the app.
   - Enter the recipient's wallet address where you want to transfer the cryptocurrency.
   - Specify the amount of crypto you want to transfer.
   - Add a message if you wish to.
   - Review the details of the transaction and ensure they are accurate.

6. **Process the Transaction:**
   - Click on the "Send Now" button on the web app.
   - MetaMask will prompt you to review and confirm the transaction details.
   - Confirm the transaction in MetaMask by paying any associated gas fees.
   - Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the Sepolia test network.
   - Verify that the transaction in the transaction history section, the crypto amount has been transferred to the recipient's wallet.
