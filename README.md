This project aims to develop a decentralized blockchain application that leverages the latest technologies of web 3.0. The application is built using Solidity, a high-level programming language used to write smart contracts on Ethereum. The Krypt Clone is designed to provide a secure and transparent platform for peer-to-peer transactions, enabling users to exchange digital assets with complete trust and immutability.
